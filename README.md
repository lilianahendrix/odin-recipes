# odin-recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project course where I will build a basic recipe website. 

Once I complete this project, I will have demonstrated some of the basic HTML skills that I learned from the first section of the course. These skills include adding headers, paragraphs, images, and links. In addition, I learned how to create unordered lists and ordered lists.
