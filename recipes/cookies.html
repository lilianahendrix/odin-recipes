        </ul>
        <h3>For the Icing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat and prepare cooking sheets.</strong> Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or lightly grease with non-stick cooking spray).</li>
            <li><strong>Whisk dry ingredients together.</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar.</strong> In a large bowl using an electric mixer, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add remaining wet ingredients.</strong> Add egg and beat to combine. Add vanilla, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Beat to combine. Scrape down bowl as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Add dry ingredients.</strong> Add flour mixture, and mix at low to medium speed just until no flour streaks remain.</li>
            <li><strong>Scoop cookie dough.</strong> Using a cookie scoop, or tablespoon to portion into 1 1/2 inch balls. Place on prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between them.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake and cool the cookies.</strong> Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. The edges will look done, but the center will still look slightly soft. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.</li>
            <li><strong>Make icing.</strong> In a small mixing bowl, combine icing ingredients. With an offset spatula, ice the top of each cookie. Adjust consistency if needed.</li>
        </ol>
